**Traffic Sign Recognition**
The process of teaching a machine to learn and make decisions on real-world situations using a set of effective algorithms is known as machine learning, or ML. A wide range of management and research fields employ the produced machine learning models. For instance, ML-enabled commercialized advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in automotive technology use traffic sign recognition. With the development of self-driving cars and the growing need for vehicle intelligence, it is essential to use computer technology to automatically detect and understand traffic signs. Autonomous vehicles can make cognitive decisions by using neural networks to interpret photos of traffic signs. Machine learning is carried out via neural networks, which are computer systems. In this work, a machine learning model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is developed to reliably recognize traffic signs and aid in decision-making when installed in autonomous vehicles.
